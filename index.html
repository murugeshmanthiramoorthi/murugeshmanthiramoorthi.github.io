<h3 style="font-size:30px; text-align: center">Data Science Intern @ bitsCrunch</h3>

<p style="font-size:15px; color: #ff7373; text-align: center">  
I am a self-motivated and self-taught Data Scientist with proven leadership skills. I am always in a quest of mastering new skills as I believe "I know nothing". I have evidenced success in both individual tasks and team works. I have been part of numerous teams and I always make sure everyone has an equal contribution. I try my maximum and make sure that I get the tasks assigned to me are completed on time. I believe time is the most valuable thing in the universe as it cannot be brought back(as of now). So I try not to waste that in any way.
