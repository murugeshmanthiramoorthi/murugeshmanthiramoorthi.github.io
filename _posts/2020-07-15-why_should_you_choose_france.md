Bonjour. In this article, I will be sharing my personal opinion on why I chose France for my higher education. Though I had an admit before my graduation 2019 along with some worthy scholarship, I was not able to make it to the University because of multiple unforseen reasons. Then after my graduation, I again started my research for my PG. But this time, the serach was intensive, unbiased and wide.

## 01. Duration of the programme is so flexible
One of the major attraction of French higher education system is that it's so flexible. If you want to complete the course fast and get into the industry very quick, you can choose 16 months MSc programs. Though time duration is short, quality of education and exposure is never compromised.
