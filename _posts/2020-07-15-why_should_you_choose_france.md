Bonjour. In this article, I will be sharing my personal opinion on why I chose France for my higher education. Though I had an admit before my graduation 2019 along with some worthy scholarship, I was not able to make it to the University because of multiple unforseen reasons. Then after my graduation, I again started my research for my PG. But this time, the serach was intensive, unbiased and wide.

# TOP 5 REASONS TO STUDY IN FRANCE

## 01. Duration of the programme is so flexible
One of the major attraction of French higher education system is that it's so flexible. If you want to complete the course fast and get into the industry very quick, you can choose 16 months MSc programs. Though time duration is short, quality of education and exposure is never compromised. 

On the other hand, if you want to get a rich expertise even before graduating from the program, you can go ahead with MIM degrees. Total duration of the program is 2 years. You are given an option to take a gap year after first year and can gain experience before completing the final year. Most colleges also have student exchange programmes with some top schools around the world. For example, in case of India, you can join a 2 yr MSc program at IMT Atlantique and you are given an option to spend a semester at [IIT Bombay, IISc Bengaluru, IIT delhi](https://www.imt-atlantique.fr/en/international/study-abroad-out/exchange-semesters) , you can join Toulouse Business School and spend a semester at [IIM Ahmedabad or IIM Calcutta](https://www.tbs-education.com/about-tbs/partners-universities/) along with many. Admission to French Universities or Business schools is very fair. You will be having an online interview along with other procedures with no intrusion from reservation, country discremintation.

Additionally, you have an option to graduate from dual degrees if you choose some specialization in the respective schools. The areas od specializations are huge and a dual degree would definitely add value to your profile and gives you an edge over others in the pool.
