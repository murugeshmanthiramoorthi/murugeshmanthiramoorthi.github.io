Here I will be showcasing my top 3 favourite projects. I will constantly updating them. So check it out often.

# Featured 
---
#### 01. Whatsapp Frequent Chat analysis
* Developed a model which can analyze whatsapp chats and deliver us valuable insights
* Determined the frequently used words, most active days and most active time of the day
* Working on determining the sentiment of chat and predicting the relationship based on the chat

---
#### 02. Detecting Malaria using CNN
* Built a Convolutional Neural Network model to predict malaria infected cases by analyzing the cell microscopic images
* Built the model with tensorflow and achieved a training accuracy of 94.5% and a validation accuracy of 94%

---
#### 03. Design and analysis of Hydrogen Propelled Mobility Vehicle
* Lead a team of 4 to completely design and analyse a hybrid Fuel Cell two-wheeler according to industry standards
* Individually designed the high-pressure storage tank, chassis, suspension system and other accessory systems using and are analyzed them
